/**
 * @short A way to ask a user a question from inside a GUI-less library (like KNewStuffCore)
 *
 * Rather than using a message box (which is a UI thing), when you want to ask your user
 * a question, create an instance of this class and use that instead. The consuming library
 * (in most cases KNewStuff or KNewStuffQuick) will listen to any question being asked,
 * and act appropriately (that is, KNewStuff will show a dialog with an appropriate dialog
 * box, and KNewStuffQuick will either request a question be asked if the developer is using
 * the plugin directly, or ask the question using an appropriate method for Qt Quick based
 * applications)
 *
 * The following is an example of a question asking the user to select an item from a list.
 *
 * @code
QStringList choices() << "foo" << "bar";
Question question(Question::SelectFromListQuestion);
question.setTitle("Pick your option");
question.setQuestion("Please select which option you would like");
question.setList(choices);
if(question.ask() == Question::OKResponse) {
    QString theChoice = question.response();
}

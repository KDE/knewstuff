 * to react to questions asked from inside the framework. This is done by creating
 * an instance of a QuestionListener, and reacting to any calls to the askQuestion
 * slot, which you must extend and implement. Two examples of this exist, in the
 * form of the KNS3::WidgetQuestionListener and KNewStuffQuick::QuickQuestionListener
 * and should you need to create your own, take inspiration from them.

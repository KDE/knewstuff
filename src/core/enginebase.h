     * tags specified for the entry itself. To filter the downloadlinks, use
     * setDownloadTagFilter(QStringList).
     *
     * @note The default filter if one is not set from your knsrc file will filter
     * out entries marked as ghns_excluded=1. To retain this when setting a custom
     * filter, add "ghns_excluded!=1" as one of the filters.
     *
     * @note Some tags provided by OCS do not supply a value (and are simply passed
     * as a key). These will be interpreted as having the value 1 for filtering
     * purposes. An example of this might be ghns_excluded, which in reality will
     * generally be passed through ocs as "ghns_excluded" rather than "ghns_excluded=1"
     *
     * @note As tags are metadata, they are provided in the form of adjectives. They
     * are never supplied as action verbs or instructions (as an example, a good tag
     * to suggest that for example a wallpaper is painted would be "painted" as opposed
     * to "paint", and another example might be that an item should be "excluded" as
     * opposed to "exclude").

     * == Examples of use ==
     * Value for tag "tagname" must be exactly "tagdata":
     * tagname==tagdata
     *
     * Value for tag "tagname" must be different from "tagdata":
     * tagname!=tagdata
     *
     * == KNSRC entry ==
     * A tag filter line in a .knsrc file, which is a comma separated list of
     * tag/value pairs, might look like:
     *
     * TagFilter=ghns_excluded!=1,data##mimetype==application/cbr+zip,data##mimetype==application/cbr+rar
     * which would honour the exclusion and filter out anything that does not
     * include a comic book archive in either zip or rar format in one or more
     * of the download items.
     * Notice in particular that there are two data##mimetype entries. Use this
     * for when a tag may have multiple values.
     *
     * TagFilter=application##architecture==x86_64
     * which would not honour the exclusion, and would filter out all entries
     * which do not mark themselves as having a 64bit application binary in at
     * least one download item.
     *
     * The value does not current support wildcards. The list should be considered
     * a binary AND operation (that is, all filter entries must match for the data
     * entry to be included in the return data)
